This is a safety feature that has been added to garage door openers to help prevent the door from closing on a car, pet, or even a child. When the door is in any position other than closed and the garage door opener is activated, the door will close. This tends to affect garage doors made before 1993. A garage door that slams will not only damage the door itself but can also be hazardous to people’s lives.

If the garage door makes contact with an obstruction while closing, the door will reverse, the opener will beep and the lights will flash 5 times. Think of a garage door’s travel limit as the distance it needs to travel to close or open entirely. If playback doesn&#039;t begin shortly, try restarting your device. If it closes before the set distance is met, it may have detected something, so it goes back up to prevent damage or safety threat.
