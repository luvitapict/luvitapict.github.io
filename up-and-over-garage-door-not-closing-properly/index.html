The door isn’t closing fully before it hits the doorstop. To increase tension for a door that&#39;s difficult to open or closes too quickly, wind the cone up (in the same direction as the garage door cable goes through the pulley).

That can be done by putting a tall stool or a ladder under the door so that it does not close accidentally when working on it.
