<h3 id="i-did-a-12ft-door-in-my-garage">I Did A 12Ft Door In My Garage.</h3><p>There is a restriction that i can't have higher than 10 feet walls on the garage, which would mean about a 9' door at max. So, for smaller boats, your garage should be at least 18 feet long and at least 20 feet long for larger ones. The bow of the boat clears the door about 18. When i put the boat in the garage the rear of the boat was about in 12 from the alcove corner and the outdrive hung into the alcove space.</p>
