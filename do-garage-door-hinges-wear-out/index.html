What style of lock for swinging garage doors that shift From diy.stackexchange.com
When these hinges are damaged, wear out or rust, then your garage doors will not operate properly. A good hinge should last about 10 or 15 years with regular use, but if your garage door cycles (opens and closes) more often than most, you may find your hinges wearing out sooner. Not only do they support the weight of doors, but they also allow those doors to swing in and out of their openings. While door hinges do wear down over time, some naturally last longer than others.
