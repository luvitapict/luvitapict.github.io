Door sensors do go bad, so if no light is showing at all, you may need to replace them. But the remote and car controls cause door to move down slightly then stop and go back up. One will have a green light, used to show that the units are powered up, and the other will have a red light to show that there’s no obstruction between the sensors and that they’re ‘seeing’ each other. If either of these lights fails to come on, you know that the sensor is not working.
