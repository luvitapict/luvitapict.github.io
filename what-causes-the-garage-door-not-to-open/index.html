Why won&#39;t my garage door opener open the door all way up? From veterangaragedoor.com
If your garage door keeps going back up after you’ve closed it, the most common reason is because: It will block the sensor from seeing and it will literally cause an obstacle of the beam which is defined as the object and as such the garage door won’t open or. If the two sensors become misaligned, this causes the sensor beam to get cut off and can cause the door to reopen after being closed. Opening the door once or twice a day will help prevent the bottom of the door from sticking to the threshold by not giving moisture time to build up and freeze.
