Reasons Why Your Garage Door Opens By Itself The Door From t-h-e-door.blogspot.com
My garage door has two sensors, either of which can cause the door to open immediately after apparently closing: Sometimes it goes out of adjustment over time as the weight of the garage door can change with humidity or moisture and/or the springs change tension especially after being replaced. Initially the door would not close all the way. I have since tried to adjust the tension on the side of the unit (up and down) and even the force knobs on.
