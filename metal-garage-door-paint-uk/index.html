Our 9 Favorite Garage Door Paint Ideas Paintzen From paintzen.com
Before painting your garage door, preparation is key to make sure your surface will adhere the selected paint effectively.

On the assumption that your garage door is made from galvanised steel then my preference would be to strip back the loose and flaking paint to a firm edge, flat down the edges, (for graduation) wet using white sprit as the lubricant then treat the bare areas with a mordant solution.
