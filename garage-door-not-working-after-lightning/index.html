Liftmaster Garage Door Opener Not Working After Power From dandkmotorsports.com
I have a craftsman model 139.18054 garage door opener and the light has been working since it was (professionally) installed 7 or so years ago and up to last monday when i had a new garage door installed. Thunderstorms, with their dramatic lightning strikes, can be as damaging as they are impressive. When this happens the circuit board on the opener and possibly the safety photo eyes may be damaged. If i purposefully misalign the sensors and try to open the garage door, the light will blink several times.
