20 Best Insulated Garage Door from TheyDesign TheyDesign From theydesign.net
Most of the insulated types of garage doors are insulated with styrofoam or also known as polystyrene, which has many varying densities. An insulated garage door will control temperature a bit, but not necessarily enough to justify the cost and time involved. That reduces energy loss along the insulated walls and ceiling. Heat and cold can escape through your garage door, and the insulation helps keep the heat (or cold) on one side of the door or the other.
