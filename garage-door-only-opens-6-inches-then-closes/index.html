The Stunning Exterior Standard Garage Door Sizes Rough From easyhometips.org
I have a garage door that will only open 6 inches and then the motor stops and the door will not move any further. In the down direction, if the limit is set beyond the point at which the door closes fully, the door will hit the floor and act as if it is hitting something and the safety feature tells it to reverse. Can i use the cfl bulbs in my liftmaster model 3800 jackshaft garage door opener? If your garage door opens part way then stops, it could be that that it’s hitting or resting on something.
